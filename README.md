## SpaceX Interface App

** Idea is to make an app that will take data from 2 places using graphQL: first from spaceX api,
 second from atlas mongodb, which can be manually created. Data from Atlas will be mutable.
 Front is going to be on react + router. Redux-like store will be created manually by me.**
